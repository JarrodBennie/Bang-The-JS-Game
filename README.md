#Bang! The JavaScript Game.

As big fans of the dice and card game "Bang! The Dice Game", by DV Giochi, we have developed a web-app version using Materialize CSS for visuals and pure JavaScript for logic.

We make no claim to be the owners of the game, its rule set, or any of its assets. This web-app is purely a passion project in order to practice writing JavaScript and we are purely fans of the game.

For the real "Bang! The Dice Game" experience please visit https://www.dvgiochi.com/catalogo/bang-the-dice-game/ and purchase a copy.

Developed by Jarrod Bennie, Craig Morton, Sam Parkyn and Adam Reid.

Our first JavaScript project - written in one week from 7th-14th April 2016, with two weeks of previous Javascript experience.
