        <ul>
          <li>Roll all five dice</li>
          <li>You may then choose to keep the dice or re-roll some or all of them up to two times. If you roll a third time, you may also re-roll any dice you didn’t choose to re-roll on your second roll. You must accept the third roll.</li>
          <li>When you are satisfied with your dice roll (or you’re out of re-rolls), resolve the dice results.</li>
          <li>Your turn is over and play passes to the player on your left.</li>

        <p><b>Important</b>: Any <b>Dynamite</b> rolled <b>cannot</b> be re-rolled (see below).</p>

                  <p>a) <b>The Sheriff is eliminated</b>: If a Renegade is the only one alive, he wins. Otherwise, all Outlaws win as a team.</p>
                  <p>b) <b>All the Outlaws <u>and</u> Renegades are eliminated</b>: The Sheriff and all Deputies win as a team.</p>
                  <p><b>Note</b>: In an 8-player game, each of the two Renegades plays on his own, and wins only if he is the last player alive. If, in the final stages of the game, the Sheriff is confronted by two Renegades and the Sheriff is eliminated first, the Outlaws win!</p>
                  <p><b>Example</b>: All the Outlaws have been eliminated, but a Renegade is still in play. In this case, the game continues. The Renegade must now face the Sheriff and his Deputies on his own.</p>
                  <p><b>Example</b>: The Sheriff is eliminated, but all the Outlaws were already eliminated and one Deputy and a Renegade are still in play. The game ends with the Outlaws winning! They achieved their goal at the cost of their own lives!</p>
                  <p><b>Example</b>: All players are eliminated at the same time. Outlaws win!</p></div>
